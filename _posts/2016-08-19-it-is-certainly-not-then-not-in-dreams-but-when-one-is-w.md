  It is certainly not then — not in dreams — but when one is wide awake, at
  moments of robust joy and achievement, on the highest terrace of
  consciousness, that mortality has a chance to peer beyond its own limits, from
  the mast, from the past and its castle-tower. And although nothing much can be
  seen through the mist, there is somehow the blissful feeling that one is
  looking in the right direction.
