  Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee, deaden thee; as for
  the time it did me. There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is
  madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down
  into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in
  the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge
  is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is
  still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.
