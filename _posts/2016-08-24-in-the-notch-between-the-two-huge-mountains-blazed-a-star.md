"In the notch between the two huge mountains blazed a star,---accurately in the notch, like the front sight of a rifle sighted into the marvelous depths of space. Then the moon rose.

"First we knew of it when it touched the crest of our two mountains. The night has strange effects on the hills. A moment before they had menaced black and sullen against the sky, but at the touch of the moon their very substance seemed to dissolve, leaving in the upper atmosphere the airiest, most nebulous, fragile, ghostly simulacrums of themselves you could imagine in the realms of fairy-land. They seemed to actually float, to poise like cloud-shapes about to dissolve. And against them were cast the inky silhouettes of three fir-trees in the shadow near at hand.

"Down over the stones rolled the river, crying out to us with the voices of old accustomed friends in another wilderness. The winds rustled."
